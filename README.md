# WanderList

## Project Overview
WanderList is a web application designed to generate personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences such as budget, interests, and trip duration. Utilizing Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model, WanderList offers a user-friendly interface that enhances the travel planning experience.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy navigation for users to input their travel preferences.
- **Multiple Input Options:** Capture essential details including:
  - City Name
  - Number of Days
  - Interests (up to three)
  - Activity Types (up to three)
  - Cuisine Types (up to two)
- **Dynamic Itinerary Generation:** Integration with the Gemini 1.5 Flash model for AI-generated itineraries.
- **Dual-Card Layout:** Two cards displaying input options and generated itineraries.
- **Local Storage:** Save and access multiple itineraries easily.

## How It Works
1. **Input Preferences:** Users fill out the form with their travel details.
2. **Generate Itinerary:** After submission, the data is sent to the Gemini 1.5 Flash model via API.
3. **Display Itineraries:** Generated itineraries appear as tiles, which can be clicked for more information.
4. **Storage:** All itineraries are stored in local storage for easy retrieval.

## User Personalization
WanderList emphasizes user personalization by allowing selections for interests, activities, and cuisine preferences, ensuring tailored itineraries. Fun elements, like emojis, enhance user engagement.

## Future Improvements
Potential improvements include better formatting of Gemini API responses and additional input options for enhanced itinerary generation.
